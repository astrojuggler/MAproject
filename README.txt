PURPOSE

If you're reading this, you most likely are a student in Astronomy and you are searching for some help with your work. Specifically, the purpose of this repository is to provide a guideline to a master student whose thesis-project involves the processing of ALMA data and/or the employment of the 3D-BAROLO software (Di Teodoro, Fraternali 2015).


STRUCTURE

The repository contains two folders:

1. How_To_Reduce_ALMA_data

2. How_To_Use_3D-BAROLO_With_ALMA_Datacube

Each of the folder includes a file instructions.txt and some .py files with code-examples commented as thoroughly as possible. Folder #2 also includes a file .par which is an example of the file you need for specifying the parameters when running 3D-BAROLO.


SOFTWARE YOU NEED

In order to process ALMA data you need the astronomical software CASA (https://casa.nrao.edu/index.shtml). 
Obviously, if you want to use the software 3D-BAROLO you need to download it (https://bbarolo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 
You will also need the software QFitsView (https://www.mpe.mpg.de/~ott/QFitsView/). 
All the softwares above are free to download on the web.


CREDIT & ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I made this repository after completing my master thesis research project at the INAF-Observatory of Brera, Milan, 2018-2019. I thank my supervisors Claudia Cicone and Paola Severgnini for introducing me to the field of Galaxies and, at the same time, teaching me pro-level data-analysis techniques, using science data of high interest.
Please feel free to use the code-examples and don't hesitate to contact me for any question, comment, correction and idea for the improvement of the data-analysis technique and of the repository.
